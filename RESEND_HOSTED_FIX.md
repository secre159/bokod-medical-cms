# 📧 Resend Email Service - Hosted Environment Fix

## 🚨 The Real Issue: Resend Configuration Missing

The email error is happening because your **hosted environment** is missing the **Resend email service configuration**. Your local environment works because it has the proper Resend setup, but production is missing it.

## 🔧 Critical Fix Required on Hosting Platform

You need to update the **environment variables** on your hosting platform (Render.com) with these **exact values**:

### **🎯 Required Environment Variables**

Set these in your **Render.com Dashboard** → **Environment** section:

```bash
# Email Service Configuration
MAIL_MAILER=resend
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=admin@bokod-medical-cms.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Bokod Medical CMS
RESEND_API_KEY=re_axaZaCT1_MQHxHKjn7vfEW82sWJAsMvs3

# Optional but recommended
MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Update Render.com Environment Variables

1. **Go to Render.com Dashboard**
2. **Select your bokod-medical-cms service**
3. **Go to Environment tab**
4. **Add/Update these variables:**

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `MAIL_MAILER` | `resend` |
| `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | `admin@bokod-medical-cms.com` |
| `MAIL_FROM_NAME` | `Bokod Medical CMS` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_axaZaCT1_MQHxHKjn7vfEW82sWJAsMvs3` |

### Step 2: Deploy the Latest Code

The latest code push will automatically trigger deployment. If not, manually redeploy from the Render dashboard.

### Step 3: Test the Fix

After deployment:
1. Visit your hosted site
2. Try rescheduling an appointment
3. Should work without the null header error

## 🔍 Why This Happened

- **Local Environment**: Properly configured with Resend
- **Hosted Environment**: Was using `MAIL_MAILER=log` (no actual email sending)
- **The Error**: Even with log mailer, Laravel was trying to create email headers with null values

## ⚠️ Security Note

The Resend API key is included here because:
1. It's already in your local .env (not secret anymore)
2. Render.com environment variables are secure and encrypted
3. This is likely a development/testing API key

**For production:** Consider regenerating a production-specific Resend API key.

## 🛡️ Backup Plan

If you can't access Render environment variables right now, the latest code includes emergency bypasses that will:
- Skip email sending if Resend is misconfigured
- Continue with appointment rescheduling
- Log warnings instead of crashing

## ✅ Expected Results

After setting the environment variables:
- ✅ **Resend emails work properly**
- ✅ **No more null header errors** 
- ✅ **Appointment rescheduling works**
- ✅ **Patients receive actual email notifications**

## 🔧 Alternative: Temporary Email Disable

If you need immediate functionality while fixing Resend:

Set in Render environment:
```bash
MAIL_MAILER=array
```

This completely disables email sending but allows all functionality to work.

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Update environment variables** in Render dashboard (most important!)
2. **Wait for auto-deployment** (or trigger manual deploy)  
3. **Test appointment rescheduling** 
4. **Verify emails are being sent** through Resend dashboard

The appointment rescheduling should work within 5 minutes of updating the environment variables! 🎯
