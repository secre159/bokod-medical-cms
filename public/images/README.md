# Logo Installation Guide

## Current Status
The system is now configured to use the medical logo provided. However, the current `logo.svg` file is a placeholder SVG that approximates the design.

## To Use the Actual Logo

1. **Save the provided logo image** as one of the following formats:
   - `logo.png` (recommended for best compatibility)
   - `logo.jpg`
   - `logo.svg` (replace current file)

2. **Image specifications:**
   - Recommended size: 300x200 pixels or similar aspect ratio
   - Format: PNG with transparent background preferred
   - Quality: High resolution for crisp display

3. **If using PNG/JPG instead of SVG:**
   Update the configuration in `config/adminlte.php`:
   ```php
   'logo_img' => 'images/logo.png', // or logo.jpg
   ```

## Current Configuration

The logo is configured in `config/adminlte.php` and used in:
- Main navigation bar (top-left)
- Login/registration pages
- Loading screen preloader

The logo will automatically scale and display with:
- Shadow/elevation effects
- Proper alt text for accessibility
- Responsive sizing

## Logo Features in the Design

The medical logo includes:
- Caduceus symbol (medical staff with serpents)
- Wings representing healing/flight
- Open book representing knowledge/education
- Gear elements representing healthcare systems
- Medical cross symbols
- Blue and gray color scheme representing trust and professionalism

This logo perfectly represents a medical clinic management system combining healthcare symbols with educational and technological elements.
