RENDER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FOR RESEND EMAIL

Add these environment variables to your Render service:

1. MAIL_MAILER=resend
2. RESEND_API_KEY=re_axaZaCT1_MQHxHKjn7vfEW82sWJAsMvs3
3. MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=admin@bokod-medical-cms.com
4. MAIL_FROM_NAME=Bokod Medical CMS
5. QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync

IMPORTANT: 
- Remove or keep the old SMTP variables as backup
- Resend uses HTTP API instead of SMTP (no port blocking issues)
- 3,000 emails/month free tier

After adding these variables, Render will auto-redeploy and emails should work immediately!
