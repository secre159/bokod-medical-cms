# No Medicine Required Enhancement

## 🎯 **NEW FEATURE ADDED**

### **Problem Solved:**
In medical practice, doctors often need to create records for consultations that don't involve prescribing actual medications, such as:
- General consultations
- Health advice and lifestyle counseling  
- Follow-up visits
- Referrals to specialists
- Preventive care screenings
- Non-medication treatments (rest, exercises, etc.)
