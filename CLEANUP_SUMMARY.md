# ✅ AWS S3 Support Removed - Cloudinary Only

## 🗑️ What I Removed

### **Packages Removed:**
- ❌ `aws/aws-sdk-php`
- ❌ `league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3`

### **Configuration Removed:**
- ❌ S3 disk from `config/filesystems.php`
- ❌ AWS environment variables
- ❌ S3 logic from all services

### **Files Removed:**
- ❌ `.env.render.example` (AWS version)
- ❌ `RENDER_CLOUD_STORAGE_SETUP.md` (AWS guide)
- ❌ `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_README.md` (AWS comparison)

## ✅ What You Have Now

### **Simple Cloudinary-Only Setup:**
```json
// composer.json - Only Cloudinary package
"cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel": "^2.0"
```

### **Clean Storage Logic:**
- ✅ If `FILESYSTEM_DISK=cloudinary` → Use Cloudinary
- ✅ If not configured → Use local storage
- ✅ No AWS complexity

### **Your Environment Variables:**
```bash
FILESYSTEM_DISK=cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dqwlnzze8
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=493942154261923
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=P52z1v1K5z3y4upKqKslgZE3CiE
```
