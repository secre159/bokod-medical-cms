# 🚨 REPLACE PLACEHOLDER LOGO WITH YOUR ACTUAL LOGO

## ❌ Current Situation
- The system is configured for your logo
- But there's currently a placeholder SVG file instead of your actual medical logo
- You sent a beautiful medical logo image that needs to be saved properly

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps:

### **Step 1: Save Your Actual Logo**

1. **Right-click** on the medical logo image you sent (the one with caduceus, wings, book, and gears)

2. **Save As** and navigate to:
   ```
   C:\Users\Axl Chan\Desktop\XAMPP\htdocs\cms\public\images\
   ```

3. **Name the file**: `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`)

4. **Recommended size**: 300x200 pixels (or keep original proportions)

### **Step 2: Verify File Location**
Make sure your logo file is saved as:
```
📁 public/
  📁 images/
    🖼️ logo.png  ← Your actual medical logo here
```

### **Step 3: Refresh Your Browser**
- Press `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh)
- Your actual logo should now appear in:
  - Navigation bar (top-left)
  - Login page
  - Loading screen

## 🔧 **Already Configured:**
✅ AdminLTE config updated to use `images/logo.png`
✅ Authentication pages configured
✅ Preloader configured  
✅ Custom CSS styling applied
✅ Medical theme colors applied
✅ Cache cleared

## 📸 **Your Logo Features:**
Your medical logo is perfect for this healthcare system because it has:
- ⚕️ **Caduceus symbol** (medical staff with serpents) 
- 🕊️ **Wings** (healing symbolism)
- 📖 **Open book** (knowledge/education)
- ⚙️ **Gear elements** (healthcare technology)
- ➕ **Medical crosses** (healthcare symbols)
- 🔵 **Professional blue/gray colors**

## 🚨 **If Logo Still Doesn't Appear:**

1. **Check file path**: Ensure logo is in `public/images/logo.png`
2. **Check file size**: Should be reasonable (under 1MB)
3. **Try different format**: Save as `logo.jpg` if PNG doesn't work
4. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl + F5 or clear browser data
5. **Check file permissions**: Make sure file is readable

If the logo still doesn't appear after following these steps, let me know and I can help troubleshoot further.
