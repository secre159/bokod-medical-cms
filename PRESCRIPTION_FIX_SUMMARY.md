# Prescription Creation Fix Summary

## ðŸš¨ Original Issue
**Error:** "The medicine id field is required."
**Cause:** The prescription form had conditional medicine selection (inventory vs custom), but the controller validation didn't account for this conditional logic.

- **Auto-date Setting:** Expiry date automatically set to 30 days from prescribed date

### 5. **Sample Data Added**

- **Realistic Data:** Includes stock levels, expiry dates, and proper medicine details
